# An Expansion Pack for The FREE FLIR Thermal Dataset for Algorithm Training
The original **FREE FLIR Thermal Dataset for Algorithm Training** can be found [here](https://www.flir.ca/oem/adas/adas-dataset-form/) with detailed description.

This expansion pack is prepared specifically for training a YOU-ONLY-LOOK-ONCE(YOLO) network. All frames are labeled in the YOLO format.
A description of the YOLO format can be found [here](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark/issues/60).

**Highlights of This Expansion Pack**
Training a YOLO(v3/v4) network only by FLIR's dataset usually yields poor performance on dogs.

Added in more **DOG** frames captured by a **FLIR A65 IR Temperature Sensor** for increased data variety.
All frames are 24-bit of dimension **875*700**.
